## Adding yourself

If you want to add yourself, submit a [PR](https://github.com/hboon/indiedevuse.com/pulls):

* add to the end of the list in [developers.json](https://github.com/hboon/indiedevuse.com/blob/main/frontend/src/data/developers.json). Make up an `id` that is unique in the file â€” use hyphens and all lowercase, not periods or MixedCase.
* an avatar image file in [avatars/](https://github.com/hboon/indiedevuse.com/tree/main/frontend/public/avatars). Keep it to about 500x500. Run ImageOptim (or equivalent) on your avatar files. It's unlikely that the file would be bigger than 300kb.

Watch out for commas in `developers.json`.

I might make minor edits to the list of tools for consistency like for spelling/casing.
